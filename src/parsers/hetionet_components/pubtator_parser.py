"""
PubTator/MEDLINE Parser for CardioKB.

This module parses PubTator Central data to extract literature-mined
associations including:
- Disease-disease co-occurrence (diseaseAssociatesWithDisease)
- Disease-symptom co-occurrence (symptomManifestationOfDisease)
- Gene-disease literature associations (supplemental)

PubTator Central provides pre-computed bioconcept annotations from MEDLINE,
updated weekly by NCBI.

Data Sources:
  - https://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pub/lu/PubTatorCentral/
  - PubTator3 API: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/research/pubtator3-api/

Output:
  - disease_disease_cooccurrence.tsv: diseaseAssociatesWithDisease
  - disease_symptom_literature.tsv: symptomManifestationOfDisease
  - gene_disease_literature.tsv: Literature-based gene-disease associations
